# MarketMind

This repository is a template for a modern Python project. It includes linting with [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), type checking with [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/), and testing with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/).

Use this setup as a starting point for new projects that require a light-weight but strict development workflow.
